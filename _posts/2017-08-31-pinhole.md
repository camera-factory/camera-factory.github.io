Before cameras are invited, the artists tried to make flat pictures with a sense of depth and space. Rules like linear [perspective]({% post_url 2017-08-30-perspective %}) help 
to guide this procedure, such as:  
<br>
- objects appear smaller as their distance increases (Diminution)
- all parallel lines (if they are not parallel to the observer's face) will converge to a single point  
(Of course, there are more ... )    
<br> 
The linear perspective is indeed a geometry problem with a precise solution, although a drawing don't have to be strictly identical to it to 
obtain a depth sense. Actually, the artists break them deliberately to create some certain illusions. But this does not belong to our topics.

In the real world, each point on a object emits lights in all direction, whose properties (its intensity, its spectrum constitution) determinate how the 
corresponding point looks like (the brightness, the color). If we want to record this scenario, we have to record these lights repectively. 
Fortunately, we have many options to record light, such as the film, the CCD sensor and so on. Actually, any light sensitive material can be 
a potential choice.    

But what happens if we take a sensor or film and put it to the world? We won't get anything except a complete white image. This is because each point 
on the sensor is the integral of everything that it sees in the world. As shown in the following figure, both point A' and B' record a bunch of lights. 
In a real scenario, A' and B' see almost the same world, resulting in almost the same value on the image.

Thus, we move the sensor behind a pinhole, which plays the role of triming the light. As we can see in figure 2, the light reaches point A' on the 
sensor only comes from point A, all other lights trying to reach A' are blocked. This is also true for point B' and any other points on the sensor. In other 
words, points in the world are mapped to different points on the sensor. Consequently, we get an image!

Actually, the word "camera" itself comes from "camera obscure", which means a dark room.  

Finally, we may ask a question: what essentially makes a camera a camera? And my answer is: a machine that does a linear projection. No matter 
it is a pinhole camera or a camera with lens, it use film or CCD sensor.
